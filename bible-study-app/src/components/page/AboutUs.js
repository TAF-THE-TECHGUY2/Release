        <p>
            I Didn’t Know I Was Me exists because so many of us have spent years searching for 
            identity, purpose, and fulfillment in places that could never satisfy us. Before I found 
            my true identity in Christ, I was caught up in things that left me empty. But everything 
            changed when I realized that only God, my Creator, knows who I truly am

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At I Didn’t Know I Was Me, our mission is to guide people in discovering and cultivating
      their true identity in Christ. We exist to help individuals understand who they are in Him
      and embrace the calling He has placed on their lives. We often refer to ourselves as
      the community of Gideons (Judges 6:12), believing that within each person lies a
      mighty warrior—one created for a divine purpose, waiting to be revealed by their
      Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our community is built on the Word of God, the only true source for discovering our
      God-given identities. Just as a product’s full potential is known only by its
      manufacturer, we believe that only God fully knows who we are meant to be. Through
      His Word, we help people uncover and walk in their God-ordained purpose, free from
      the labels and limitations of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not to be who the world says we are, but to become who God says we are.

  <div className="vision-box">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      At I Didn’t Know I Was Me, our vision is to create a community where people discover,
      embrace, and walk in their true identity in Christ. We exist for all the Gideons of this
      world—those who struggle with self-doubt, uncertainty, and the weight of the world’s
      expectations—helping them see themselves as God sees them: mighty, chosen, and
      purpose-filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      We envision a generation rooted in the Word of God, the only true source of identity,
      where individuals no longer conform to the world’s standards but step boldly into who
      God has called them to be. Through fellowship, study, and authentic connection, we
      seek to awaken purpose, ignite faith, and build a community that reflects God’s truth.

            <p>
                In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vision was birthed in my 
                heart—a vision that would later become the foundation of “I Didn’t Know I Was Me.” 
                At the time, my life was in complete disarray. While the world was physically locked 
                down, the isolation I felt was far deeper. It was spiritual. I had no direction, no sense of 
                identity, and no purpose. I was lost in every sense of the word.
                In the midst of this chaos, God spoke to me. He gave me a clear and seemingly strange 
                instruction: "Buy a podcasting kit." It didn’t make sense. I wasn’t even attending church, 
                and my life was deeply entangled in the things of the world. I was in a place where I 
                had no idea who I was or what I was meant to do. Yet, in my attempt to be faithful to 
                what I thought was my calling, I obeyed. I bought the equipment. And then… I did 
                nothing.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                For three years, that microphone sat untouched, collecting dust. Like Jonah, I ran from 
                the call. I fought with God. I argued with Him. I ignored the voice that continued to 
                remind me of the assignment He had given me. But no matter how much I tried to 
                move on and escape the pull, that microphone remained, silently witnessing the 
                purpose I was meant to fulfill.
                As time passed, life continued to challenge me. I failed my matric exams. I attempted 
                to upgrade and failed my supplementary exams. I spiraled into depression, and at one 
                point, I even tried to take my own life. I broke my collarbone—not once, but multiple
                times. I endured heartbreak after heartbreak. I dropped out of school, feeling 
                completely lost and purposeless. I sought to fill the emptiness inside me with anything 
                and everything—yet nothing worked.
                <br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn’t until May of 2023, at the lowest point in my life, that I finally surrendered. I 
                stopped running. I went back to the podcasting kit, dusted it off, and obeyed the call 
                that had been waiting for me all along. That moment of surrender was the turning point 
                in my life. Everything changed from there.
                Now, my mission is simple: to help others discover their true identity in Christ and step 
                into their calling. "I Didn’t Know I Was Me" is a platform dedicated to all those who are 
                struggling with their identity—those who feel lost, just as I once did. It’s a space for 
                individuals to uncover the identity that God has placed within them, not the identity 
                that the world has tried to impose upon them.
                Every vessel has its beauty hidden within. Just like me, your true identity is already 
                inside you, waiting to be unearthed. You don’t have to go through life not knowing who 
                you are. You don’t have to struggle with confusion and uncertainty.
